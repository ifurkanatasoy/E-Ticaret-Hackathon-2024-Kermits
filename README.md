# Presentation 
You can view the presentation [here](https://github.com/ifurkanatasoy/Kermits/blob/f8edc7d79ddb6fffb21aee092858ebddc808fb7f/Presentation.pptx).

# Quick Start Guide
## Requirements
 1. **Python:** To use this code you have to be using Python 3.10 or higher.
 2. **Dependencies:** Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following code:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Now to run the code, you need to use Streamlit. Run the `app.py` file using the following code:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
2. Open another terminal and install `pyngrok` if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pyngrok
````
3. Set it up:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken "$YOUR_AUTHTOKEN"
ngrok http 8501
```
after setting it up a link will pop up indicated with `Forwarding`, click it to open the page.
> [!NOTE] 
> You have to Sign up for ngrok to able to run it. Obtain your authtoken from Your Autotoken page.
Now you're ready to go and run the code ðŸŽ‰

# Overview of Code Functionality

## Background Removal
Our Streamlit application contains two tabs. The first tab is for background removal. To get the output, you simply need to:
1. Upload an image of the product.
2. Enter the description of the product you want.
3. Choose the language in which you want the output.

### User Interface:
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ifurkanatasoy/Kermits/blob/main/assets/background-removal-tab.jpeg " width="1000" />
</div>



### Result:

<div align="center">


 | Before | After |
|---------|---------|

</div>

## Object Removal
The second tab provides an object removal feature. Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. Upload an image.
2. A screen will pop up displaying two images:
   - Original image
   - Draw mask
   - Generated mask
3. Use your cursor to draw on the "Draw mask" image, marking the area you want to remove. You will see the generated mask on the right.
4. After that, similar to the first tab, enter your description, choose the language for the output, and click the "Send" button.

## Upscaling
In addition to the object and background removal features already present in our application, we've introduced an image upscaling function. After removing an object or background, the image is automatically upscaled to enhance its resolution. This ensures that both our model and the user can view even the finest details with clarity, delivering a more refined and high-quality result. This enhancement improves the overall user experience by providing sharper and more detailed images post-processing.

### Result:

<div align="center">

</div>



## Text Generation
We've added a powerful text generation feature in both tabs of our application. After hitting the "Send" button, our models generate a detailed product description based on both the provided image and prompt. So to say, the Llama 3.2-11B-Vision model serves as the eyes of the Gemma-2-27B-IT model. We produce professional results with Gemma by incorporating the information extracted by the Llama Vision model. 

As you can see in the first example, although we did not explicitly state that the product is "sugar-free," the Llama Vision model correctly identified it as such.

### Result:
